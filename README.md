## Abstract 
> Deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural  Networks  have  been  broadly  applied  intodiverse  numbers  of  sectors  such  as  surveillance  due  to  highaccuracy. Inspired by the recent situation on pandemic outbreaksand,  concurrently,  surveillance  system  application  involvementin  public  using  AI,  we  build  Convenets  architectures  for  binaryimage  classification  task  of  face  mask  classification.  The  aim  ofthe  project  is  to  identify  human  face  images  wearing  a  maskand   not   wearing   a   mask.   The   experiments   are   based   on   apublic dataset available on Kaggle that was collected combiningGoogle  searches  and  the  CelebFace  dataset.  In  this  reportwe  will  discuss  the  classification  performance  of  the  differentnetwork  architectures  based  on  classification  accuracy  metrics,such  as  f1-score,  and  performance  metrics  including  number  ofparameters.  We  are  investigating  the  corollary  of  pre-trainednetworks  for  transfer  learning  as  opposed  to  learning  fromrandom  initialization
