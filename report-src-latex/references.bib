The Handbook of Research on Machine Learning Applications and Trends: Algorithms, Methods, and Techniques provides a set of practical applications for solving problems and applying various techniques in automatic data extraction and setting. A defining collection of field advancements, this Handbook of Research fills the gap between theory and practice, providing a strong reference for academicians, researchers, and practitioners.}
